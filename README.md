# Analyzing Students Mental Health
Studying abroad is an exciting yet challenging experience. In this project, I analyzed data from a Japanese international university's study on the mental health of international students. By leveraging data manipulation techniques, I uncovered key factors impacting student mental health and provided insights to inform supportive measures.

Key Highlights:

1. Cleaned and manipulated data to explore mental health trends.
2. Identified significant factors influencing international studentsâ€™ well-being.
3. Gained insights to support mental health initiatives in academic settings.

This project showcases my data analysis skills and my ability to draw actionable insights from real-world datasets.
