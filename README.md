# Analyzing Students Mental Health
The global gaming market is projected to surpass $300 billion by 2027, making video games a lucrative industry. In this project, I analyzed critic and user scores alongside sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. My goal was to identify the "golden age" of video games by exploring trends in user and critic preferences over time while examining the business side of gaming through sales data.

Key Highlights:

1. Analyzed critic and user scores to identify top-rated release years.
2. Explored sales data to understand the financial side of gaming.
3. Gained insights into the evolution of video game quality and success.

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze data trends, extract meaningful insights, and connect findings to industry-relevant questions.
